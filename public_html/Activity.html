                        Kids of all ages seem to love connecting dots to reveal a picture and they'll get to do just that in this printable activity for kids.<br>
                        There are easy, intermediate, and difficult connect the dots puzzles here that include connecting numbers and the alphabet.<br>
         If you have an older child that needs more of a challenge, there are even connect the dots worksheets that have them skip count to reveal the picture.

                <p>A step up from coloring sheets, these printable color by numbers will have your children matching and using a legend to color in a picture.<br>
                    Besides regular color by number printables, there are also color by numbers that require the kids to perform some type of calculation to read the key.<br> 
                 These are really great for older kids who crave that creativity in each subject they study.
